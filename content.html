    <p> Assassin's Creed is a 2007 sandbox style action-adventure-stealth video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and
      published by Ubisoft. The game was released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in November 2007 and for PC in
      April 2008. </p>

    <p> The game centers around the use of a machine dubbed the "Animus", which allows its user to view the genetic
      memories of their ancestors, centering around the protagonist, a bartender named Desmond Miles. As Desmond relives
      the memories of one of his ancestors, the Assassin Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad who lived in the Holy Land during the Third
      Crusade, details of a battle between two ancient sects – the Knights Templar and the Assassin Order – emerge as
      both scour for an artifact known only as a "Piece of Eden." </p>

    <p> Assassin's Creed received primarily positive reviews, for both its story and its gameplay, and received several
      awards at 2006's E3. In November 2009, a sequel in the form of Assassin's Creed II was released, building on the
      foundation set by Assassin's Creed. </p>

    <h1>Gameplay</h1>

    <p> Assassin's Creed is a non-linear action-adventure video game, during which the player controls a 12th-century
      Levantine Assassin named Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad during the Third Crusade, whose life is experienced through the Animus
      by his 21st century descendant, Desmond Miles. The overall goal of the game is to rise through the ranks of the
      Assassin Order by carrying out a series of assassinations given by the leader of the Order, Al Mualim. In doing
      so, Altaïr travels from Masyaf to cities in the Holy Land, specifically Jerusalem, Acre, and Damascus.

    </p>

    <p> Upon arrival in any of the cities, Altaïr must locate an Assassins' Bureau and discuss his tasks with the local
      Rafiq, an agent of the Brotherhood, gaining basic knowledge of his target. From there, it is up to Altaïr to
      perform additional reconnaissance via eavesdropping, interrogation, meeting with informants, and gathering
      important items. It is only after Altaïr has gathered enough information that he can carry out the assassination.
      After successfully completing an assassination, Altaïr returns to Masyaf to debrief with Al Mualim, and is
      subsequently rewarded with better equipment, before he is given the names of his next targets.
    </p>

    <p> Between main memories, Desmond must direct Altaïr to high points in the city to further synchronize his
      surroundings and map out the city that Altaïr is currently located in. Other side memories include tracking and
      killing Templars, flag collecting, and saving citizens who are being threatened by city guards. </p>

    <p> Accompanying this, Altaïr needs to carry out most of his actions without being noticed by officials. The game
      uses a meter dependent on social stealth to inform the player of how noticeable Altaïr is to surrounding
      individuals, including the guards, by changing the color and shape of the Abstergo logo; performing certain
      actions at certain times may or may not raise the local area's awareness level. If an area is on high alert,
      indicated by the logo becoming red and the entire synchronization interface earning a red tinge and background,
      guards will be always vigilant and citizens will scatter in various directions in the event that the guards chase
      and attempt to bring down Altaïr. To reduce his notoriety, Altaïr must break the guards' line of sight and then
      find a hiding place, blend in with wandering scholars, or join citizens sitting on benches. </p>

    <p> To conduct many of the assassinations and various other tasks, Altaïr is capable of both high and low profile
      commands, both of which affect the alertness level. Low profile commands will allow Altaïr to blend into crowds,
      hide, and use Altaïr's Hidden Blade to attempt quiet and low profile assassinations. High profile commands
      increase alertness at a greater level and include free-running, attacking foes, and high profile assassination
      attempts. In the event that the player finds themself faced with multiple enemies, one can utilize Altaïr's
      sword-fighting abilities to combat guards. </p>

    <p> This game introduces air assassinations and chain-kills. To do so, one must equip the Hidden Blade, climb to the
      top of a short building or hang from a ledge at an appropriate point, then look back, hold the high profile button
      and finally, press the attack button toward the desired target while running, hanging from a ledge, performing a
      wall eject or remaining close to the target from a suitable height. For chain-kills, one must equip the Hidden
      Blade while locked onto an enemy; hold the high profile button and counter-attack them with the Blade, and while
      another enemy reacts in surprise or is distracted, dash forward to assassinate them in turn.</p>

    <p> Health in Assassin's Creed is measured as the level of synchronization between Desmond and Altaïr's memories.
      Whenever Altaïr is injured, it is experienced as a deviation from the actual memory that occurred and
      synchronization decreases. If there is complete desynchronization, the current memory that Desmond is experiencing
      dematerializes and restarts at the last stable checkpoint. </p>

    <p> Because Altaïr's memories are rendered by the Animus software, "glitches" may often be experienced with
      nucleotides and error messages appearing. These glitches can be used to help identify targets and if the player
      reacts quickly enough, may be used to provide other vantage points during cut-scenes. </p>
